# CS789-Cryptography-Project
functions_new.py: All the cryptographic functions taught in class to be used for this project
rsa_algamal.py: Simple UI implementing the RSA and Diffie-Hellman algorithm with with functions from functions_new.py
test.py: Unit test file

## rsa_algamal.py User Guide
- The user will be prompted to choose between the RSA or Diffie_Hellman algorithm
  - They will then choose their roles:
    - Encrypt:
    - Decrypt:
    - Intercept:
